Lost at the Market is rather a simple game with very minimal puzzle elements. 
While the choices are pretty straightforward a few interactive objects throughout the game are to be used to progress through the story.

The game tries to make good use of GRUESCRIPT although in my opinion it only scratches the surface.
I may not be that great at puzzle designs but participating in the IFCOMP keeps me more in touch with the happenings of the competition.
I love to read the reviews and try my best to learn from the suggestions.
Hopefully someday I will make a very nice game.

At the beach, while the conversation holds its merits to the story, you have to break the sand castle to get to the next portion.
At the roof, to open the door go to the adjacent room, open the water tank, use the stick while on the roof to open the door.
At the bathroom, use the wrench to unbolt the toilet and then you can take it. 
At the stage you need your guitar to play, get your costume and go to the backstage, or take the exit and read the envelope.

I hope you wil have fun playing this piece of interactive fiction.
